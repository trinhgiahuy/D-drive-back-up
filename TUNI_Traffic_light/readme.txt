These are the Traffic Ligth VHDL examples for course TKT-1212Implementation of Digital Systems, spring 2013.Simple Traffic light is used for showing few ways to implement afinite-state machine (FSM) is VHDL. External timers (tb in our case)request FSM to change to green or red. FSM has a internal timer foryellow light. Tb has also a state machine.Structure	Sim		Script for compiling and waves.
