<h1 style="color:red;margin-left:250px;margin-top:-20px;">If-Else</h1>
<h3 style="color:red;">Introduction</h3>
<p>We use if statements in our everyday life all the time - even if our everyday life is not written in Python. If the light is green then I'll cross the road; otherwise I'll wait. If the sun is up then I'll get out of bed; otherwise I'll go back to sleep. Okay, maybe it's not this direct, but when we take actions based on conditions, our brain does what a computer would do: evaluate the conditions and act upon the results. Well, a computer script doesn't have a subconscious mind, so for practicing data science we have to understand how an if statement works and how we can apply it in Python!</p>

<p>Let's say we have two values: a = 10 and b = 20. We compare these two values: a == b. <br>This comparison has either a True or a False output. (Test it in your Jupyter Notebook!)</p>
<img src="https://data36.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2-Python-if-statement-comparison-1-768x148.png">
<p>We can go even further and set a condition: if a == b is True then we print 'yes'. <br>If it's False then we print 'no'. And that's it, this is the logic of the Python if statements. <br>Here's the syntax:</p>
<img src="https://data36.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Python-if-statement-example-768x226.png">
<p>Run this mini script in your Jupyter Notebook! The result will be (obviously): no.</p>
<p>Now, try the same - but set b to 10!</p>
<p>The returned message is yes.</p>

<h1 "left-margin:400">Python if statement syntax</h1>
<p>Let's take a look at the syntax,<br> because it has pretty strict rules.</p>
<p>The basics are simple:</p>
<img src="https://data36.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Python-if-statement-syntax-768x273.png">
<p>You have:</p>

<p>1.an if keyword, then</p>
<p>2.a condition, then</p>
<p>3.a statement, then</p>
<p>4.an else keyword, then</p>
<p>5.another statement.</p>
<p>6.However, there are two things to watch out for:</p>
<p ID="page1">1. Never miss the colons at the end of the if and else lines!</p>
<img src="https://data36.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Python-if-statement-syntax-colon-768x315.png">
<p ID="page1">2. And never miss the indentation at the beginning of the statement-lines!</p>
<img src="https://data36.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Python-if-statement-syntax-indentation-768x306.png">
<p>If you miss any of the above two, an error message will be returned saying "invalid syntax" and your Python script will fail.</p>
<h3>Python if statements - level 2</h3>
<p>Now that you understand the basics, it's time to make your conditions more complex - by using arithmetic, comparison and logical operators. (Note: if the word "operators" does not ring any bells, you might want to check out this article first:</p>

<p>This script will return yes, since both of the conditions, (a + b) / c == 1 and c - b - a == 0 are actually True and the logical operator between them was: and.</p>
<img src="https://data36.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Python-if-statement-multiple-conditions-768x250.png">
<p>Of course, you can make this even more complex if you want, but the point is: having multiple operators in an if statement is absolutely possible - in fact, it's pretty common in real life scenarios!</p>
<h3>Python if statements - level 3</h3>
<p>You can take it to the next level again, by using the elif keyword (which is a short form of the "else if" phrase) to create condition-sequences. "Condition-sequence" sounds fancy but what really happens here is just adding an if statement into an if statement:</p>
<img src="https://data36.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/10-Python-if-statement-condition-sequence-logic-768x355.png">
<p>Sure enough the result will be "second condition is true".

</p>
<img src="https://data36.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Python-if-statement-condition-sequence-768x300.png">
<p>You can do this infinite times, and build up a huge if-elif-elif-...-elif-else sequence if you want!
<br>
And... This was more or less everything you have to know about Python if statements.</p>
